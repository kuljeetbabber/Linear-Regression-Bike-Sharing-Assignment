# Bike Demand Prediction Assignment
This repository contains the code and data for the Bike Demand Prediction assignment for Executive PG Programme in Machine Learning & AI - February 2023 course. The goal of this assignment is to build a model to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors.

## Problem Statement
The bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has faced revenue dips due to the ongoing pandemic and wants to understand the factors that influence the demand for shared bikes in the American market. The assignment aims to analyze the dataset and build a predictive model to determine the significant variables and their impact on bike demand..

## Approach
I used Python and its data analysis libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset and sklearnm, statsmodels for developing model. The EDA process involved data cleaning and manipulation, data analysis and visualization.


## Conclusions
I have generated the models and figured out the factores affecting the bookings
